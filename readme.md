# Slider that uses CSS transitions if the browser supports them

This slideshow uses CSS transitions if the browser supports them and if it doesn't then if falls back to jQuery and uses jQuery's animation method.

This isn't a full fledged plug-in, just something I made for a client and felt was a good example of how to set something like this up. You can check out my blog post about it here: [Use CSS if you can then fall back to JavaScript](http://goo.gl/pOSvY)
